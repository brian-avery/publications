This talk was given with Eric Van Norman at Istiocon 2021 with the summary:

> Another Istio release is out! You may be nervous, but we have been continuously improving our release qualification process to hopefully ease your concerns. In 2020, we collected feedback and used it to focus on producing higher quality and more consistent releases. We created a Definition of Done to determine what it means for releases and features to be considered stable. This has led to release notes tooling, standardized feature maturity levels and release gates. We also created a new Upgrade Workgroup to improve the stability, user experience, and test infrastructure around Istio upgrades. This talk will explore what each of these new additions means for you as a user and whether you can trust that new release or feature in your production environment. We’ll be sure to leave some time for feedback. We’d love to know how these changes are or are not addressing your concerns as well as other improvements you would like to see.

This talk was given with Jacob Delgado at Istiocon 2021 with the summary: 

> The Istio Product Security Working Group operates behind a bit of secrecy given the nature of the group’s work; mostly triaging security reports and threats. In 2020, there were over 11 security bulletins released that spanned from Istio 1.3 to Istio 1.8. In this talk, we will explain why the group was created, how it operates, and its mission to make Istio more secure.
> Namely, we will discuss:
> * A brief history of how the group was formed
> * Why it was necessary for the group to be created
> * A look at Istio security vulnerabilities in 2020
> * How we triage security reports and fix them
> * Pro-active measures the group is working on to make Istio more secure
> * Please join us to learn about the responsibilities of the Product Security Working Group and how to stay informed about the security of your environments.
